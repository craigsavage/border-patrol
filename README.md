# Border Patrol - CSS Outliner & Debugging Tool

Border Patrol is a browser extension that outlines every element on a webpage, helping developers and designers visualize layouts, margins, and padding instantly. This extension provides a simple yet powerful way to debug CSS box models.

## Features

Border Patrol handles applying borders (we use the outline property) to every element so that it becomes easy to visually understand the structure of any webpage. This makes it incredibly easy to debug layout issues caused by CSS properties like width, padding, and margins.

- Instantly outlines all elements on a webpage.
- Helps debug layouts, margins, and padding.
- Lightweight and easy to toggle on/off.
- Customizable options for the style and thickness of the borders.
- Open-source with community contributions.

Use the shortcut `Alt+Shift+B` to toggle borders on any page

### Inspector Mode
- Displays a functional overlay containing information about the CSS styles for the hovered element, such as: dimensions, borders, margins, padding, etc...
- Visually highlights the space occupied by each element

### Open-source with community contributions
This is open source, so anyone can contribute to the extension.
