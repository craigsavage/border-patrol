# Border Patrol - CSS Outliner & Debugging Tool

Are you tired of digging through complex CSS and hovering endlessly in DevTools just to figure out element boundaries, margins, and padding? **Border Patrol** is the free and open-source Chrome extension built to solve that frustration!

It's a powerful visual debugging tool that instantly reveals the structure and box model of any webpage. Perfect for web developers, designers, and QA testers, it makes understanding layouts, identifying spacing issues, and debugging CSS problems faster and more intuitive than ever before.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Instant Visual Outlining:** Apply color-coded outlines to _every_ HTML element on a page with a single click or shortcut. See nested structures and element boundaries at a glance.
- **Visualize the Box Model:** Clearly visualize element boundaries, margins, and padding, helping you understand element spacing and dimensions.
- **Detailed Element Inspector:** Activate Inspector Mode and simply hover over any element on the page to view a real-time overlay displaying its tag name, precise dimensions (`width` x `height`), and computed border, margin, and padding styles.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Tailor the outlines to your preference by easily adjusting their size (from `1px` to `3px`) and style (`solid, dashed, dotted, double`) via the extension's intuitive popup menu.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Easily capture and download screenshots of the current page with your outlined elements, perfect for documentation, bug reports, or sharing layout feedback with your team.
