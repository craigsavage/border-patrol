    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/border-patrol.git
    cd border-patrol

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/craigsavage/border-patrol.git
    ```
4.  **Sync with Upstream:** Before starting work, sync your `dev` branch with the latest changes from the main repository's `dev` branch.
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout dev
    git merge upstream/dev
    ```
5.  **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution based on the `dev` branch. Use a descriptive name related to your work.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-contribution-branch-name dev
    ```
6.  **Set up the Development Environment:**
    - Open Google Chrome.
    - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.

7.  **Implement Your Changes:** Write your code, fix the bug, or implement the feature in your new branch.
8.  **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your changes in the Chrome development environment to ensure they work correctly, address the intended issue or feature, and do not introduce new bugs. Test across different websites if relevant.
9.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages. Aim for concise summaries in the first line and more detail in the body if needed.
    ```bash
    git add .
